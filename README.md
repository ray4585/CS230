# CS230
module 8 journal 
  This is my fianl project for my CS230 class, overall the class was very challenging and it was one of my hardest courses so far. This project is a software designt template, and is for a company called The Gaming Room which is an online gaming site that you can play different games with your friends. This game is called draw it or lose it which is a multiplayer or single player game that draws from a library of images and you have to take guesses on what is depicted. This is the final project of an assignment that we worked on throughout the course and slowly added too throughout the term. If i could revise one part of the assingment it would have to be the final thoughts section, it boosted my grade from the previous time we submitted the project and I believe this is the most important part because its where you draw all your conclusions and make your recommmendation. I believe the part I did particularly well was the coding/chart the actual meat and potatoes of the project and my strong suits as I know a wide cariety of programming languages.
